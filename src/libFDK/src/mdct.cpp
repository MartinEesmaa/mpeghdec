This program implements the forward MDCT transform on an input block of data. The input block is in
a form (A,B,C,D) where A,B,C and D are the respective 1/4th segments of the block. The program takes
the input block and folds it in the form:
(-D-Cr,A-Br). This block is twice shorter and here the 'r' suffix denotes flipping of the sequence
(reversing the order of the samples). While folding the input block in the above mentioned shorter
block the program windows the data. Because the two operations (windowing and folding) are not
implemented sequentially, but together the program's structure is not easy to understand. Once the
output (already windowed) block (-D-Cr,A-Br) is ready it is passed to the DCT IV for processing.

This program implements the inverse modulated lapped transform, a generalized version of the inverse
MDCT transform. Setting none of the MLT_*_ALIAS_FLAG flags computes the IMDCT, setting all of them
computes the IMDST. Other combinations of these flags compute type III transforms used by the MPEG-H
multichannel tool for transitions between MDCT/MDST. The following description relates to the IMDCT
only.

If we pass the data block (A,B,C,D,E,F) to the FORWARD MDCT it will produce two outputs. The first
one will be over the (A,B,C,D) part =>(-D-Cr,A-Br) and the second one will be over the (C,D,E,F)
part => (-F-Er,C-Dr), since there is a overlap between consequtive passes of the algorithm. This
overlap is over the (C,D) segments. The two outputs will be given sequentially to the DCT IV
algorithm. At the INVERSE MDCT side we get two consecutive outputs from the IDCT IV algorithm,
namely the same blocks: (-D-Cr,A-Br) and (-F-Er,C-Dr). The first of them lands in the Overlap buffer
and the second is in the working one, which, one algorithm pass later will substitute the one
residing in the overlap register. The IMDCT algorithm has to produce the C and D segments from the
two buffers. In order to do this we take the left part of the overlap buffer(-D-Cr,A-Br), namely
(-D-Cr) and add it appropriately to the right part of the working buffer (-F-Er,C-Dr), namely
(C-Dr), so that we get first the C segment and later the D segment. We do this in the following way:
From the right part of the working buffer(C-Dr) we subtract the flipped left part of the overlap
buffer(-D-Cr):

Result = (C-Dr) - flipped(-D-Cr) = C -Dr + Dr + C = 2C
We divide by two and get the C segment. What we did is adding the right part of the first frame to
the left part of the second one.   While applying these operation we multiply the respective
segments with the appropriate window functions.

In order to get the D segment we do the following:
From the negated second part of the working buffer(C-Dr) we subtract the flipped first part of the
overlap buffer (-D-Cr):

Result= - (C -Dr) - flipped(-D-Cr)= -C +Dr +Dr +C = 2Dr.
After dividing by two and flipping we get the D segment.What we did is adding the right part of the
first frame to the left part of the second one.   While applying these operation we multiply the
respective segments with the appropriate window functions.

Once we have obtained the C and D segments the overlap buffer is emptied and the current buffer is
sent in it, so that the E and F segments are available for decoding in the next algorithm pass.*/
